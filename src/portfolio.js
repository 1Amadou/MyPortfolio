  leftDescription: `
  Hello, my name is Amadou CISSE, a student majoring in Mechatronics and Robotics at the Faculty of Science and Technology in Bamako. I'm also a graduate of Dive into Code (https://diver.diveintocode.jp) with the "Advanced Web Engineering Course" (Ruby) training program, which gave me a solid foundation in the field of computer science. Recently, I achieved certification as a FullStack developer through this program.

  I am continuously passionate about learning and evolving in this new domain, which, for me, is not very different from what I study at the university. 

  I've been fortunate to attend various workshops, including project management and embedded systems, among others, at the Francophone Employability Center. These training sessions have broadened my horizons in the field of entrepreneurship.

  I enjoy thinking and working on ambitious projects that have a positive impact on the world and attempting to solve challenges.
